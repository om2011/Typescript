##TypeScript Course code
-The Code is seperated according to the course sections
-Each section folder consist of differen folders named with the concept taught and contains the code for that part
-The code is present in the src folder either in the app.ts file or sandbox.ts file
-in some folders I have also added some screenshots of the code in which the concept is used
