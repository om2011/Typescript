## TypeScript Course Code

The code is separated according to the course sections.

- Each section folder consists of different folders named after the concept taught.
- Each concept folder contains the relevant code for that part.
- The code is located in the `src` folder, either in the `app.ts` file or the `sandbox.ts` file.
- In some folders, screenshots are included demonstrating the concept in use.
